 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  The code randomly generates an array of N number of integers and calls for the method  quickSort which uses that
 *  sorting algorithm to sort the array in an ascending order. The code also calculates the execution
 *  time of the sorting process and prints it to stdout when the array has been sorted. The quick sort algorithms
 *  performance is improved by calling insertionSort when it wants to sort tiny sub arrays. The reason is that
 *  Insertion Sort is a faster algorithm than Quick Sort for those type of arrays. The cut off for how large sub
 *  arrays to sort can be manipulated by changing the value of the conditional in quickSort which calls for insertionSort.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions in the Sorting Lab PM. The implementation to the algorithms of
 *  Quick sort and Insertion Srt has been taken from the book "Algorithms", where algorithms 2.2 and 2.5 has been used.
