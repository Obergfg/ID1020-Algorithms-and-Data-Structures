 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 * The code reads a positive number from stdin into an int variable named nrElements. The number can be
 * read either as an input from the user or from a text file depending on which method is called upon
 * in the program. The value entered is the number of elements in a dynamically allocated array of integers.
 * With that number an array of integers  with nrElements elements is created. The program then reads nrElements
 * integers from stdin and stores them in the array. Lastly the elements of the array are printed to to
 * stdout in reverse order compared to how they were input.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions of the Preporatory Lab PM.
