 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  The code takes input from a text file (input.txt) in form of characters, and filters every 'a' character in the file
 *  into an 'x' character and outputs the filtered text to another text file (output.txt). This procedure continues
 *  until the program reaches an EOF character. Then the program is terminated.

 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions of the Preporatory Lab PM.
