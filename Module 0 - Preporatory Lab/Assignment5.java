 *
 * Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 * The code constructs a data structure in form of a binary tree. It contains of of nodes
 * each of which contains a key in form of a integer and to nodes(left and right) which is used
 * to connect each node to two other nodes down the binary tree. If a given node has a
 * key which is equal or higher than the current node (the root) them that node is refrenced via
 * the right node. If the key is lower than the roots key, the it is referenced via the left
 * node of the root.
 * To execute the code an array of type <>int</> is sent through a <>Assignment5</> object which
 * instantiates the object. The tree can then be printed out in three different ways by calling
 * the methods printPrefixTraversal, printInfixTraversal or printPostFixTraversal. A specific key
 * ina a <>Assignment5</> can also be searched for via the method hasElement by sending a root <>Node</>
 * and the key being searched for in form of a <>int</>.
 *
 *
 * Code based upon:
 * The code has been based upon the instructions of the Preporatory Lab PM.
