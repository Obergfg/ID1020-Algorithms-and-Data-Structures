 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  The takes input in form of a string and based on the arguments sent to main via the command line, the code specifies which key was
 *  the most frequently used in the input string as well as the keys between the given indices indexHigh and indexLow. All of this
 *  information gets sent to stdout.
 *
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions in the Searchin Lab PM and the book "Algorithms" were the
 *  class FrequencyCounter were used as a base for this extended version..
