 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  The code represents a unordered symbol table. It stores input in form of keys with its associated
 *  value in a linked list. Keys can be searched for by a sequential searching algorithm.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions in the Searching Lab PM and the book "Algorithms" were the algorithm
 *  3.1 were used as a basis.
