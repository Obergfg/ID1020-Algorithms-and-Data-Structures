 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  The code counts the number of individual words from a given string input and outputs the word which is most
 *  frequent - key with the highest value.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions in the Searching Lab PM and the book "Algorithms" were the symbol table
 *  FrequencyCounter were used as a basis for this code.
