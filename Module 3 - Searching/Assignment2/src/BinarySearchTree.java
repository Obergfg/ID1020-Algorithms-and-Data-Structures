 *  The code represents a symbol table built as a Binary Search Tree. It stores input in form
 *  of keys with its associated value in nodes which are put into the tree and can output the content of the tree
 *  to stdout.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions in the Searching Lab PM and the book "Algorithms" were the algorithm
 *  3.3 were used as a basis.
