 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  The code calls for the two methods: iterative and recursive, They both let the user
 *  input characters and presents them in reversed order. The iterative method accomplishes
 *  this by using an iterative method where a while loop runs through all the input characters
 *  until an end of line character has been reached. The recursive iterates through all input
 *  and calls for itself until an end of line character has been sent as an argument. Then the method
 *  iterates back through all the input characters and prints them.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions of the Fundamentals Lab PM and the course literature
 *  "Algorithms".
