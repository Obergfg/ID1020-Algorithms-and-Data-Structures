 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  The code serves as a filter which determines if a file has balanced parenthesis, i.e. if the parentheses in a given
 *  file appears of the same amount and in correct order. This is accomplished by inserting the file into a <>StringBuilder</>
 *  object and then iterating through that object analyzing each and every one of the characters in the <>String</>. If the file
 *  is balanced the <>boolean</> variable "balanced" is set to true, if else it is set to false and the program notifies
 *  the given result to the user.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions of the Fundamentals Lab PM and the course literature "Algorithms".
