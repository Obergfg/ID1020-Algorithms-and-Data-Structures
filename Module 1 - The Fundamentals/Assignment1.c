 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *	The code lets the user input 10 characters if the function iterative is called, and it lets 
 *	the function input any amount of characters if the function recursive is called. The characters 
 * 	are then sent to stdout where they are presented in reverse order from which they were 
 *	entered
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions of the Preporatory Lab PM.

/**
*	Lets the user input characters and presents them in reversed order. This is done 
*	by using a recursive implementaition where the function is called with putchar as 
*	argument. As long as the input character is not the next line/enter character, 
*	the function calls itself. When the next line character is reached the characters
*	are sent to stdout through putchar. Since they are printed lasly in the function 
*	the characters become printed in the reversed order from the one entered.
*
*	@param c is the character being checked if its end of line or not(Ascii value of 10).
