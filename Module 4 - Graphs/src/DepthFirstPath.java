 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  The code uses a depth first search algorithm to find paths to all the vertices in a given graph that contains
 *  a given source vertex. It marks every vertex visited in a boolean array called "marked" which marks all vertices that
 *  are connected to the source vertex. The client can use the instance method pathTo() to iterate through the vertices
 *  on a path from a given vertex to any vertex connected to the given.
 *  The instance variable array "edgeTo" is an array of <>int</> values that serves the purpose of a ball of string(a method
 *  used in the so called Tremaux exploration of a maze which is an old method used for exploring a maze, or graph in this case).
 *  The "edgeTo" array therefore helps the code to find a path back to the source vertex for every vertex connected to the source.
 *  The depth in "Depth First Search" implies that the algorithm chooses one path from the source vertex and itertes for as long as
 *  that route has unmarked adjacent vertices. It goes as deep as possible in the graph before trying the next possible
 *  root from the source.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions in the Graphs Lab PM as well as the algorithm 4.1
 *  in the course literature "Algorithms" by Sedgewick and Wayne.
