 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  This code finds the shortest path between two vertices in an edge weighted graph whose edges are non-negative.
 *  The algorithm used is called Dijkstra's algorithm which grows the shortest path by adding an edge at a time,
 *  updating the shortest path if the edge from an already investigated vertex to a non investigated has a lower
 *  weight than the already known weight between the source and the current vertex. It then outputs the path to stdout
 *  with the total associated weight of the path.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions in the Graphs Lab PM as well as the algorithm 4.9
 *  in the course literature "Algorithms" by Sedgewick and Wayne.
