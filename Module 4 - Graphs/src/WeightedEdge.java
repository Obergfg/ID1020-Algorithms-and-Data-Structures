 *  Problem the code solves, how it is used,(executed, input, outputs etc.):
 *
 *  The code creates a weighted edge which can be used in a graph. It has two vertices in form of a generic item type
 *  and a weight attribute which states the weight of the edge.
 *
 *  Code based upon :
 *
 *  The code has been based upon the instructions of the Graph Lab PM and the data type on page 610
